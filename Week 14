Quiz:
1. 
Suppose we have learned 3 ranked rules as followings. (The default is Type 2.)
{“ipad”, “iphone”} -> Type 1
{“kindle”, “iphone”} -> Type 2
{“ipad”} -> Type 1
For the people who have {“ipad”, “kindle”, “iphone”}, which type will they be classified as by the CBA algorithm?

Ans:
Type 1

False:
Type 2


2. Suppose we have learned 2 rules as follows:
R1:  {“ipad”, “iphone”} -> Type 1.  ( Sup(R1) = 200,  Conf(R1) = 90% )
R2:  {“ipad”, “iphone”, “ipod”} -> Type 1.   ( Sup(R2) = 200,  Conf(R2) = 90% )
Which rule will be pruned by the CMAR algorithm?

Ans:
a. R2

False:
a. R1
b. Neither



3. Which of the following reasons is NOT an advantage of pattern-based classification methods 
compared to other classification methods such as decision tree?
Ans:
a. No need of training data  

False:
a. Capable of handling complex data, e.g., graphs, sequences, etc.
b. Compact representation of learned model
c. Generating higher-order features


4. Suppose we have the following data for classification using K-nearest neighbors.
The yellow points belong to the positive class and the purple points belong to the negative class.
Ans:
Positive 

False:
Negative




5. Which of the following sayings are correct about the nearest neighbor classifier?
Select all that apply.
Ans:
a. The nearest neighbor classifier can be used for both classification and regression tasks.
b. Increasing the parameter k makes the k-nearest neighbor classifier more robust to outliers and noise.

False:
a. The classification accuracy improves when the parameter k gets larger.
b. The nearest neighbor classifier is slow in both training and prediction.



6. Suppose we have learned 3 ranked rules as followings. (The default is Type 2.)
{“ipad”, “iphone”} -> Type 1
{“kindle”, “iphone”} -> Type 2
{“ipad”} -> Type 1
For the people who have {“kindle”, “iphone”}, which type will they be classified as by the CBA algorithm?
Ans:
Type 2

False:
Type 1




7. Suppose we have the following data for classification using K-nearest neighbors.
The yellow points belong to the positive class and the purple points belong to the negative class.
Given a new data point at (-1.5,0), what will it be classified into when k=5?
Ans:
Negative 

False:
Positive 



8. Using the data from Question 4, which label will the new point be assigned if we use distance-weighted nearest neighbor algorithm with k=5?
Ans: 
Positive 

False:
Negative
